# LightRP
The original roleplay gamemode for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/) created by Rick Darkaliono and philxyz, fixed by Yushe.

This gamemode was the basis for the highly popular [DarkRP](https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP) gamemode.

One module is available and active in the gamemode, hunger mod.

To disable this module either drag out or delete `HungerMod.lua` from the `gamemode/modules/` folder.

## Changes
I have made a few minor changes to the gamemode.
These changes aren't anything major and have been done to keep the gamemode more playable.

**The changes I have made are listed below:**
* Changed the thirdperson look of the keys "weapon" as it would make the player look like there holding a revolver.

*(I have left a fixed unedited version of this SWEP under the name keys_original for anyone that cares.)*
* Added code to make it so only admins can noclip, I have no idea why this wasn't a thing in the first place.

*(Maybe LightRP was even less rule strict than old DarkRP used to be?)*
* Changed the gamemode name from LightRP Reloaded to LightRP.
* Added proper fall damage.
* Changed the names of jobs on the vote menus.
* Made the list of commands print in console until I can fix the F1 menu.

## What now?

I will fix up the remaining issues with this gamemode when I am in the mood, unless there is a major bug discovered.
Other than that feel free to fork this gamemode and do what you please with it.
